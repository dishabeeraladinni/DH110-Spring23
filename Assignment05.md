## Low-Fidelity Prototype

#### The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to create a simple, rough, and unfinished representation of a design idea or solution that can be easily and quickly modified based on feedback and testing. By creating a physical or digital prototype, designers can test and validate their design concepts with users, get feedback, and improve their designs before moving on to high-fidelity prototyping and development.
