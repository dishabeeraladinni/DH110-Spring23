## Contextual Inquiry

### Introductory Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

* This project will support users in being able to connect with family and friends by playing games. Specifically, a variety of games that facilitate connection. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

* The activity fulfills the user’s basic need of staying connected with friends and family and including a belonging of love. By playing games online, it allows users to connect and play games with their friends, even if they are not physically in the same location. This can help users feel more connected and involved in their friendships, which can lead to a greater sense of belonging and love as well as create memories. 


#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?


#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

* 1. GamePigeon is only offered for iphone users which means Android users are unable to enjoy the app. 
* 2. While GamePigeon allows users to play games with friends, there are no social features like a friend list or chat function within the app. 
* 3. GamePigeon does not allow users to save their progress in a game and return to it later, which can be frustrating if a game takes a long time to play.
