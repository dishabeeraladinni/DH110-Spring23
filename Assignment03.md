## Contextual Inquiry

### Introductory Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

* This project will support users in being able to connect with family and friends by playing games. Specifically, a variety of games that facilitate connection. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?

* The activity fulfills the user’s basic need of staying connected with friends and family and including a belonging of love. By playing games online, it allows users to connect and play games with their friends, even if they are not physically in the same location. This can help users feel more connected and involved in their friendships, which can lead to a greater sense of belonging and love as well as create memories. 


#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

* Current solutions to satisfy this need for staying connected to family and friends include social media apps: Instagram, Whatsaap, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. In terms of gaming apps, there includes Heads Up/Charades, HouseParty and Trivia Crack that can stay connected with family/friends on mobile devices. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

1. GamePigeon is only offered for iphone users which means Android users are unable to enjoy the app. 

2. While GamePigeon allows users to play games with friends, there are no social features like a friend list or chat function within the app. 

3. GamePigeon does not allow users to save their progress in a game and return to it later, which can be frustrating if a game takes a long time to play.

### ✅ Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

* Demographics: students (high school, college undergraduates), young adults, working adults and iOS users
* Preferences: users who are likely to be those who enjoy playing games with friends and family through messaging apps
* Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application, just users who enjoy all levels of games and know how to use iMessage

#### Where would the users do that activity? 

* Users would do this activty on mobile devices as these devices have become the powerhouse to accessing all kinds of information on the tip of our hands. Since it is an app, users can play these games from almost anywhere as long as there is internet connectivity. This includes being at home, work, school, vacation, etc. It is like sending a text, however in game format.  

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
* The users would follow these steps:
1. Ensure that they have an iPhone or iPad with iMessage installed.

2. Download and install the GamePigeon app from the App Store.

3. Open iMessage and start a conversation with a friend or family member.

4. Tap on the App Store icon and then the GamePigeon icon to access the app's games.

5. Select a game to play and follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.

6. Play the game and try to win against their opponent.

7. Continue playing games with their friend or family member, either by selecting another game or playing the same game again.

### ✅ Step 3: Pick Research Methods

* I incorporated a combination of two methods: overt observation: participatory interaction and interview.
* Since the user knows they were being observed, they engaged in two activities (Partipatory interaction): 
1. Activity One: Finding a game on GamePigeon: I asked the user how they would approach in selecting a game to play; what kind of details do they consider?

2. Activity Two: Playing the game with an opponent: I asked the user to play a game with their opponent, and how they felt after being able to text a game to their friend/family. During this activity, the opponent the user was playing against was me as a choice of convenience for the user. 

* For the interview, I used my computer and the software zoom to record their backstory of playing games. The interview was conducted at each other's respective homes over zoom. During the zoom, both of our faces are visible but not at the same time. The faces appear as who is talking.


### ✅ Step 4: Observation/Interview Guide

* Please find the link to the interview script [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GhdwZYFFsc5Pg_nkjIlgUQl9UEVAmla3BTuQa-U41QY/edit?usp=sharing)

### ✅ Step 5: Conducting the Research

* Please find the recording of the interview [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ztTBFCK9SHNm7XoN7)
* Please find the transcript [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfj7R1Mb1ZNWDReMf01XxrkbgkkkGwpW225zj4pVE4A/edit?usp=sharing)

### Some interesting quotes/insights from the interview:

#### 1. User's preference of how the games should be displayed (00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:49.590)
I would wish for more games, or like, maybe like, sort it out according to category. Like a card game, or like a marble game, or a real-life imitation game. Right now, there is a lot going on [and] my eyes are going everywhere. 

#### 2. These tiny games opened up a new perspective (00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:48.270)
It opened up a new perspective like I should just send people random games all the time. I forget like there is I can do more than just text. I can send all these games. It's just like another text you send to people.

#### 3. User's preference of instructions (00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:29.360)
I think some instructions were unclear, but otherwise it was fun. [Something like] if player one will be going first, or a player, 2 will be going first.

#### 4. User's preference of both players seeing which game is being decided (00:22:54.190 --> 00:23:12.830)
Shortlisting the options. I think the most difficult part was just to decide which one, what seems more interesting, and which one would. Like, whoever I play with, find [the game] interesting to like. I don't want it to just be me who's having fun.

#### 5. Provides a fun way to take a break from reality (00:23:42.990 --> 00:24:14.710)
It provides entertainment for sure, and something that I can use if like. Oh, if I haven't talked to this friend in a while. But I don't know what to start with. I get to send them a game, and then we can like talk about like catch up, or anything. So I think it's a nice like little break from reality. and something that is can just be used as like light icebreakers or something that just like, you know, for fun you can use with a friend.


### ✅ Step 6: Reflection

The contextual inquiry process felt more organic and natural in terms of understanding the user's behavior, preferences, and needs. When comparing it to the usability testing, the contextual inquiry process offers first-hand data and open handed questions, which is more accurate than survey data. For example, during the usability testing, users were asked to select a scale of answers (most likey, less likely, neither, etc), in which doesn't provide the freedom of expressing how they truly felt whereas in the contextual inquiry process, it helps gain a deeper understanding of a user's preferences. Most of the points articulated by the participant alligned with mine, however I believe I did give away some bias when questioning the participant. For example, in my question, "What do you look at before selecting a game?", with a followup "The colors? The graphics? The name? The instructions?" gave a biased approach for the particpant to answer the question as it already filtered out the options.
