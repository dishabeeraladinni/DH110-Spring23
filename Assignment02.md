## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The Charades app is a mobile application that allows users to play the classic game of charades on their phones or tablets. Charades is a game in which players act out a word or phrase without speaking, while their teammates try to guess what they are acting out. The Charades app provides a list of words or phrases for players to act out, and teammates can guess by typing their answers into the app.

During the heuristic evaluation on the app Charades, there included several usability concerns.
First, 


With these concerns, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate how the app enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct certain tasks. A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the application. In Task 1, I will ask the user to navigate to the “How to Play” section of the app. This task is designed to understand the ability of the user to promptly land in the “How to Play” section of the app and observe the difficulty/feedback expressed by the user. In Task 2, I will ask the user to play the game for forty five seconds using the countries category. This task is designed to observe the efficiency of starting a game and the satisfaction/emotions expressed during the game. This task delves into whether the user felt the game was an enjoyable and interactive experience. In Task 3, I will ask the user to create their own deck/category or pick their favorite deck with the options provided. This task is designed to see the user was satisfied with personalizing their options. With this UT testing, I hope to achieve the feedback to improve the app's usability from the user's perspective.

### Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet dorm room. The moderator and participant will be sitting adjacent to each other, and another participant for task 2 will be present. A computer will record the participant’s reactions throughout the test and will display a survey that the moderator will use to guide the participant. The participant will use her ipad, which will be screen recorded and posted as a different recording. This is a pilot trial to test the setting, materials, and software in order to improve the usability testing process. The user will perform other elements of the testing including: how quickly tasks are completed, the degree of satisfaction/comfort the user feels towards the app, discussing potential solutions for improvement, and choosing five words that most characterize his/her experience during the testing. Lastly, the user will complete a section on demographic data which will be kept confidential.

### Link to the UT Video

Since the zoom software didn't enable dual sharing side by side, there are two files. The first one is a link to the UT Testing and the second one is the screen recording of the tasks performed on the app on the phone. To follow the screen recording, you can open both links as place them side by side to follow along.
