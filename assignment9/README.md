# GamePigeon UX Redesign

## UX Project by Disha Beeraladinni

Introduction: This project, conducted through the course Digital Humanities 110 in Spring 2023 at UCLA, involved redesigning GamePigeon to be more user-friendly for all levels of tech users using research and design process: heuristic analysis, usability testing, contextual inquiry and user research to designing and testing my own prototype on Figma.

###  Clear design statement: 
The design of the project support users in being able to connect with family and friends by playing games. Specifically, a variety of games that facilitate connection and a greater sense of belonging of love. By playing these games online, it allows users to connect and play games with their friends that creates memories, even if they are not physically in the same location. 

### Competitor analysis:
In order to reach my design statement, I was thinking of resdesigning the applications: Heads Up and Whatsaap, to develop a more connected feeling for users. However, Whatsaap already being a huge platform for connecting family/friends through messaging, video calling, and audio calling; there leaves little room to redesign and implement any updates for satisfactory user experience. On the other hand, Heads Up is one of the games that allow users to stay connected and have fun with each other but requires everyone to be in the same location. With this analysis and heuristic evaluation, I decided to redesign GamePigeon where people of all backgrounds and ages as well as technical levels have the chance to play games with the click of a text button. Here is a snapshot of my heuristic evaluation comparing Heads Up vs Whatsaap and can read more [here](https://github.com/dishabeeraladinni/DH110-Spring23/blob/main/Assignment01.md):

Heads Up:

| Heuristic & Description | Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement
| :---                    |    :----:            |          ---: |
|1. Visibility of system status: Provide users the status of the game and what each button on the interface performs | Good: Turns green when the player successfully guesses the word and red otherwise; indicated when the time is up.                | No Improvement: The green and red are obvious colors making it clear for the users/players of what the game does.              |
|2. Match between system and the real world: The app should speak the user's language and general knowledge | Good: It offers categories and difficulty level based on the user's preference. It also allows them to choose the category and time limit they prefer.               | No Improvement: This is helpful as it makes the game very entertaining and engaging with preferred choices.              |
|3. User control and freedom: Allow users to navigate the app easily | Good: Users can easily pause/resume and quit the game. They can even create their own category of cards and customize their own settings.                | No improvement: This is really helpful for users of when they can pause/resume the game. The customization brings users to have a fun time with their friends/family.              |
|4. Consistency and standards: Follow established design and interaction standards, such as using familiar icons and terminology, and maintaining consistency in the layout  | Good: Includes a minimalist interface with a list of categories to choose from, such as movies, animals, and famous people, and users can swipe left and right to view more categories. Also includes animations and sound effects make it easy to use and engaging.         | No Improvement: This doesn't restrict to only one category and gives the users/players more freedom with the topics.                |
|5. Error prevention: Prevent errors by providing clear instructions and feedback to users | Bad: Doesn;t provide an undo button or a button to prevent the user from loosing their progress.                 | Improvement: Including an undo button would be helpful for accurate results or an extra chance to makeup for the missing card.               |
|6. Recognition rather than recall: Minimize user's memory in navigating the interface and app should be easy to navigate  | Good: When a user tilts their phone up, the app displays an arrow pointing up to indicate that they are skipping a card. When a user tilts their phone down, the app displays an arrow pointing down to indicate that they are guessing a word or phrase correctly               | No Improvement: This is helpful for the player as they are guided to whether they successfully guessed the card or not. |
|7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Customize the usage of the app based on user's preference | Good: Allows users to choose their preferred category, difficulty and time limit               | No Improvement: This helps users to enjoy their time when playing the app.                |
|8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: Uses clear and concise language to communicate information to users on the app interface  | Good: Utilizes a simple color scheme of white, black, and blue. The font is clear and easy to read, and the icons are intuitive and easy to understand. The animations and the sound effects makes the game more engaging and fun.               | No Improvement: This elevates the quality time of the group of players playing Heads Up; especially with family members/friends.               |
|9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages/problems should be expressed and suggest a solution to solve them | Bad: Doesn't incllude a question bot on the app.              | Improvement: Including a bot would be helpful for the players in receiving immediate solutions.               |
|10. Help and documentation: Provide clear instructions to help users navigating the app | Good: The app provides a link to a support page on the developer's website which includes frequently asked questions. Also includes a help section that contains detailed instructions on how to play the game.                 | Improvement: Having a question bot/support page on the app would make it helpful to anser any questions.               |
