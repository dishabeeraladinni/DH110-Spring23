# GamePigeon UX Redesign

## UX Project by Disha Beeraladinni

Introduction: This project, conducted through the course Digital Humanities 110 in Spring 2023 at UCLA, involved redesigning GamePigeon to be more user-friendly for all levels of tech users using research and design process: heuristic analysis, usability testing, contextual inquiry and user research to designing and testing my own prototype on Figma.

###  Clear design statement: 
The design of the project support users in being able to connect with family and friends by playing games. Specifically, a variety of games that facilitate connection and a greater sense of belonging of love. By playing these games online, it allows users to connect and play games with their friends that creates memories, even if they are not physically in the same location. 

### Competitor analysis:
In order to reach my design statement, I was thinking of resdesigning the applications: Heads Up and Whatsaap, to develop a more connected feeling for users. However, Whatsaap already being a huge platform for connecting family/friends through messaging, video calling, and audio calling; there leaves little room to redesign and implement any updates for satisfactory user experience. On the other hand, Heads Up is one of the games that allow users to stay connected and have fun with each other but requires everyone to be in the same location. With this analysis and heuristic evaluation, I decided to redesign GamePigeon where people of all backgrounds and ages as well as technical levels have the chance to play games with the click of a text button. Here is a snapshot of my heuristic evaluation comparing Heads Up vs Whatsaap and can read more [here](https://github.com/dishabeeraladinni/DH110-Spring23/blob/main/Assignment01.md):
