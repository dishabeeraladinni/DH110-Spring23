## Interface Design

### Description of Project

### Purpose of Interface Design

### Design Process

I first created my prototype on paper and then later implemented it digitally using Figma. On Figma, I chose a phone frame as GamePigeon since it is primarily used on messaging platforms. After all the information logistics, I implemented a grid to determine the best information structure. Then, I determined the typography styles of all texts, which would immediately give a rough estimate of the shapes and sizes of the buttons. After several rounds of iterations of the wireframe, I developed a color scheme for both themes: light and dark.

### During my impression testing, I did a 5 second test and showed the design for 5 seconds. After the 5 second test, I asked her for her first impressions and what she could recall about the design. The following are her first impressions:
