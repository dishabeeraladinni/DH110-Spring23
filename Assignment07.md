## High Fidelity Prototype

### Description of Project
My goal for this project is to design an app where people of all backgrounds and ages as well as technical levels have the chance to play games with the click of a text button. This app fulfills the userâ€™s basic need of staying connected with friends and family and including a belonging of love. By playing games online, it allows users to connect and play games with their friends, even if they are not physically in the same location. This can help users feel more connected and involved in their friendships, which can lead to a greater sense of belonging and love as well as create memories.

## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to efficiently build a gaming app that allows users to stay connected to their family members. This is through the tasks that can be performed after receiving feeback for the initial stages of the wireframe. 

## Process of Project
The protoype was created on Figma, a UI/UX platform that helps create prototypes. I first drew out my wireframe on paper and then digitalized it using the features on Figma. For the interface design, I performed impression tests to get feeback on the color palette, typography, and shape variation. 

## Tasks:
creating own avatar, choosing the background music and background of the game, utilize the chat option during the game, and shares game progress

## Prototype
Here is the final [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/zk5Wfaqx0rUgu1ntqOQqnz/high-fidelity-prototype?type=design&node-id=9-126&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A126&show-proto-sidebar=1)
