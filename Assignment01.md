# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

#### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other. 

#### In order to delve deeper, I thought of how the apps Heads Up and WhatsApp strongly bring in quality time and engagement in order to maintain the connectedness. In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of these two apps. Heads Up offers an interactive way to play games with the family and Whatsaap offers various communication methods to stay connected in real time.

### Heads Up

2) [Heads Up App Homepage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)

3) The app Heads was originally created by Ellen DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment. The app is available on both iOS and Android devices and designed to be played with friends and family. The main objective of Heads Up is: players hold their mobile device up to their forehead, and the other players give clues to help them guess the word or phrase that appears on the screen. Players have to guess as many words or phrases as possible within a time limit. The app comes with a variety of categories to choose from, including movies, celebrities, animals, and etc. The app also includes features such as the ability to record and share gameplay videos, as well as the option to create custom decks with your own words or phrases.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is a great way to engage and connect with family members as it offers a wide range of categories and the ability to create custom decks. It is a great party game or icebreaker in social settings enabling communication and strong engagement. The app is easy to navigate but can be limited to certain age groups as some topics may not be age appropriate.

### WhatsApp

2) [WhatsApp Homepage](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

3) WhatsApp is a messaging app that allows users to send/receive text messages, photos/videos, documents and make video/audio calls for free and with end-to-end encryption. This allows users to have their text messages and calls to be secured and only accessed by the sender and receiver. This app was originally created in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton and is available on both iOS and Android devices.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is very useful in helping family members staying connected all through out the world. As it also ensures end-to-end encryption, Facebook being its parent company brings privacy into question. It is a plus that this app is a free service, however it does require internet connection which can be difficult in areas with poor connectivity.
