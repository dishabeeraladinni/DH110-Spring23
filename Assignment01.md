# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

#### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other. 

#### In order to delve deeper, I thought of how the apps Heads Up and WhatsApp strongly bring in quality time and engagement in order to maintain the connectedness. In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of these two apps. Heads Up offers an interactive way to play games with the family and Whatsaap offers various communication methods to stay connected in real time.

### Heads Up

2) [Heads Up App Homepage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)

3) The app Heads was originally created by Ellen DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment. The app is available on both iOS and Android devices and designed to be played with friends and family. The main objective of Heads Up is: players hold their mobile device up to their forehead, and the other players give clues to help them guess the word or phrase that appears on the screen. Players have to guess as many words or phrases as possible within a time limit. The app comes with a variety of categories to choose from, including movies, celebrities, animals, and etc. The app also includes features such as the ability to record and share gameplay videos, as well as the option to create custom decks with your own words or phrases.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is a great way to engage and connect with family members as it offers a wide range of categories and the ability to create custom decks. It is a great party game or icebreaker in social settings enabling communication and strong engagement. The app is easy to navigate but can be limited to certain age groups as some topics may not be age appropriate.

The customization brings users to have a fun time with their friends/family.              |
|4. Consistency and standards: Follow established design and interaction standards, such as using familiar icons and terminology, and maintaining consistency in the layout  | Good: Includes a minimalist interface with a list of categories to choose from, such as movies, animals, and famous people, and users can swipe left and right to view more categories. Also includes animations and sound effects make it easy to use and engaging.         | No Improvement: This doesn't restrict to only one category and gives the users/players more freedom with the topics.                |
|5. Error prevention: Prevent errors by providing clear instructions and feedback to users | Bad: Doesn;t provide an undo button or a button to prevent the user from loosing their progress.                 | Improvement: Including an undo button would be helpful for accurate results or an extra chance to makeup for the missing card.               |
|6. Recognition rather than recall: Minimize user's memory in navigating the interface and app should be easy to navigate  | Good: When a user tilts their phone up, the app displays an arrow pointing up to indicate that they are skipping a card. When a user tilts their phone down, the app displays an arrow pointing down to indicate that they are guessing a word or phrase correctly               | No Improvement: This is helpful for the player as they are guided to whether they successfully guessed the card or not. |
|7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Customize the usage of the app based on user's preference | Good: Allows users to choose their preferred category, difficulty and time limit               | No Improvement: This helps users to enjoy their time when playing the app.                |

|9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages/problems should be expressed and suggest a solution to solve them | Bad: Doesn't incllude a question bot on the app.              | Improvement: Including a bot would be helpful for the players in receiving immediate solutions.               |

Also includes a help section that contains detailed instructions on how to play the game.                 | Improvement: Having a question bot/support page on the app would make it helpful to anser any questions.               |

Severity Rating:
1. Top Priority: Visibility of system status; Aesthetic and minimalist design; User control and freedom; Match between system and the real world; Recognition rather than recall
2. Important to fix:  Help users recognize, diagnose; and recover from errors, Help and documentation; Error prevention
3. Small Inconvenience: Error prevention

### WhatsApp

1) ![WhatsApp screenshot](download.jpg)

2) [WhatsApp Homepage](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

3) WhatsApp is a messaging app that allows users to send/receive text messages, photos/videos, documents and make video/audio calls for free and with end-to-end encryption. This allows users to have their text messages and calls to be secured and only accessed by the sender and receiver. This app was originally created in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton and is available on both iOS and Android devices.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is very useful in helping family members staying connected all through out the world. As it also ensures end-to-end encryption, Facebook being its parent company brings privacy into question. It is a plus that this app is a free service, however it does require internet connection which can be difficult in areas with poor connectivity.

Match between system and the real world: The app should speak the user's language and general knowledge | Good: Offers the option of selecting the user's language and using the app in the user's preferred language.           | No Improvement: This is helpful as it allows non English speakers to navigate the app in their preferred language and connect with their family/friends.              |

|5. Error prevention: Prevent errors by providing clear instructions and feedback to users | Good: Always asks users to provide feedback after a voice/video call.                |No Improvement: This is really helpful as the app is constantly trying to get feedback and update the app to common preferences of the users.               |

|7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Customize the usage of the app based on user's preference  | Good: Can customize the chat wallpaper to user's preference.
