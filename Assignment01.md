# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

#### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other. 

#### In order to delve deeper, I thought of how the apps Heads Up and WhatsApp strongly bring in quality time and engagement in order to maintain the connectedness. In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of these two apps. Heads Up offers an interactive way to play games with the family and Whatsaap offers various communication methods to stay connected in real time.
