# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

#### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other. 

#### In order to delve deeper, I thought of how the apps Heads Up and WhatsApp strongly bring in quality time and engagement in order to maintain the connectedness. In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of these two apps. Heads Up offers an interactive way to play games with the family and Whatsaap offers various communication methods to stay connected in real time.

Players have to guess as many words or phrases as possible within a time limit. The app comes with a variety of categories to choose from, including movies, celebrities, animals, and etc. The app also includes features such as the ability to record and share gameplay videos, as well as the option to create custom decks with your own words or phrases.
