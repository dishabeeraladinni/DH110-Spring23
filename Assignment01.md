# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

#### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other. 

#### In order to delve deeper, I thought of how the apps Heads Up and WhatsApp strongly bring in quality time and engagement in order to maintain the connectedness. In this assignment, I will be conducting a heuristic evaluation of these two apps. Heads Up offers an interactive way to play games with the family and Whatsaap offers various communication methods to stay connected in real time.

### Heads Up

2) [Heads Up App Homepage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)

3) The app Heads was originally created by Ellen DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment. The app is available on both iOS and Android devices and designed to be played with friends and family. The main objective of Heads Up is: players hold their mobile device up to their forehead, and the other players give clues to help them guess the word or phrase that appears on the screen. Players have to guess as many words or phrases as possible within a time limit. The app comes with a variety of categories to choose from, including movies, celebrities, animals, and etc. The app also includes features such as the ability to record and share gameplay videos, as well as the option to create custom decks with your own words or phrases.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is a great way to engage and connect with family members as it offers a wide range of categories and the ability to create custom decks. It is a great party game or icebreaker in social settings enabling communication and strong engagement. The app is easy to navigate but can be limited to certain age groups as some topics may not be age appropriate.

|5. Error prevention: Prevent errors by providing clear instructions and feedback to users |                |               |

### WhatsApp

2) [WhatsApp Homepage](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

3) WhatsApp is a messaging app that allows users to send/receive text messages, photos/videos, documents and make video/audio calls for free and with end-to-end encryption. This allows users to have their text messages and calls to be secured and only accessed by the sender and receiver. This app was originally created in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton and is available on both iOS and Android devices.

4) Overall Evaluation: I believe this app is very useful in helping family members staying connected all through out the world. As it also ensures end-to-end encryption, Facebook being its parent company brings privacy into question. It is a plus that this app is a free service, however it does require internet connection which can be difficult in areas with poor connectivity. 

| Heuristic & Description | Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement
| :---                    |    :----:            |          ---: |
|1. Visibility of system status: Turns blue when the text messages/media/documents have been read | Good: Clearly shows when the messages/media/documents have been delivered and turns blue instantly they have been read by the receiver. Also shows _typing_ when the user is typing a message or _busy_ when in a call on the app                |               |
|2. Match between system and the real world: The app should speak the user's language and general knowledge | Good: Offers the option of selecting the user's language and using the app in the user's preferred language.           | No Improvement: This is helpful as it allows non English speakers to navigate the app in their preferred language and connect with their family/friends.              |
|3. User control and freedom: Allows users to navigate easy on the interface | Good: Users have the ability to delete/archive their messages/media and control their privacy settings (who can see their profile picture and status). Bad: It can be difficult to get to the privacy page especially for non-tech users as it consists of layers. Once at the privacy section, there are many options/choices to navigate through.              | Improvement: Make the privacy section more visible.              |
|4. Consistency and standards: Follow established design and interaction standards, such as using familiar icons and terminology, and maintaining consistency in the layout  |Good: Follows a consistent theme and font, uses headers/bolding when necessary. Follows a white and green color scheme giving it a modern look and for the calls section, there includes a phone/video camera symbol.           | No improvement: The logo helps users what the app is designed for and the symbols are helpful for non tech users.          |
|5. Error prevention: Prevent errors by providing clear instructions and feedback to users |                |               |
|6. Recognition rather than recall: Minimize user's memory in navigating the interface and app should be easy to navigate | Good: There includes  4 main tabs: Chat, Status, Calls, and Settings making it easier switch between each section. Bad: Once in the Settings section, there are many subsections for the privacy feature, which may be difficult for non-tech users to go through all the questions regarding privacy.               | Improvement: In the privacy subsection, it can be helpful to include a gif or visual to show what each privacy setting can do.               |
|7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Customize the usage of the app based on user's preference  | Good: Can customize the chat wallpaper to user's preference. Bad: Doesn't provide an option to select the size and font of the chat                | Improvement: Provide shortcuts to perform frequent actions                |
|8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: Uses clear and concise language to communicate information to users on the app interface | Good: Follows a white and green color scheme giving it a modern look and the phone inside the text message logo makes it easy to navigate on the app screen. Includes 4 main tabs: Chat, Status, Calls, and Settings making it easier switch between each section.       | No Improvement: The logo is creative as it follows the app's main purpose. The colors are bright to capture the user's attention.               |
|9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages/problems should be expressed and suggest a solution to solve them  | Good: Always asks users to provide feedback after a voice/video call, and will get back to a solution for any expressed error.   | Improvement: This is helpful for WhatsApp as they can make more edits/versions based on the feedback.              |
|10. Help and documentation: Provide clear instructions to help users navigating the app  | Good: Any new features on the app are taught/released on the status feature of the app                   |        |
