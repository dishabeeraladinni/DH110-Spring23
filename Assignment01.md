# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Disha Beeraladinni, DH110

## Tenative Title: Familial Connectivity Maintenance 

### I am interested in how to maintain the connectedness within a family in order to build a strong relationship and promote a healthy family dynamic. These ways can include communication, engagement, emotional support, quality time, and etc. Family is the backbone of our lives, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. However, in our fast-paced modern world, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to nurture these relationships. Therefore, I am eager to discover new strategies for maintaining meaningful connections with family members, whether it's through regular communication, shared activities, or simply making time for each other.
